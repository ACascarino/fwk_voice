This program uses the Total Phase Cheetah SPI Host adapter (and optionally the
Total Phase Aardvark Host Adapter to make use of the SPI IRQ output) to read
audio out from Avona to a PC over the SPI interface. In order to run this
program, the Cheetah (and optionally Aardvark) shared library binary file
must be obtained at the following links.
