USER GUIDE
##########

The XMOS Avona Reference Design User Guide is written for system architects and engineers designing Far-field voice systems using the xcore.ai processor. The document describes typical usage models, the processor architecture, key feature operation, and interface definitions. In conjunction with the product datasheet, these two documents provide all the information required for system design, from concept to production testing and verification.

It is expected that this document is read in conjunction with the relevant datasheet and that the user is familiar with basic voice processing terminology.
